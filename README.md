# FlightForge: Advancing UAV Research with Procedural Generation of High-Fidelity Simulation and Integrated Autonomy

This repository contains the code for the **FlightForge: Advancing UAV Research with Procedural Generation of High-Fidelity Simulation and Integrated Autonomy** presented in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05038v1) and the [project website](https://mrs.fel.cvut.cz/flight-forge). 
The documentation can be found [here](https://ctu-mrs.github.io/docs/simulations/FlightForge/).
The ROS package is available in the [ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_unreal_simulation](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_unreal_simulation) repository.
For usage without ROS can be found in the [ctu-mrs/mrs_flight_forge_connector](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_flight_forge_connector) repository.
